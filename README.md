# About fft2d-swift-playground

This repo contains a Swift playground that illustrates the 2D image *FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)* algorithm.

Note that the original code is in Javascript, which is written by [@turbomaze](https://github.com/turbomaze). I just rewrite it in Swift and play it in Xcode playground. You can find the original JS implementation at [here](https://github.com/turbomaze/JS-Fourier-Image-Analysis).
